Hey potential Employer!
                               I used a variety of methods in each and every webpage just to show the diversity of my skillset.
You will see I do things differently like with the nav bar. One of them is with divs another is using <li>. When i code for your 
company I will be consistent. This is just to show I can solve problems in multiple ways.This is my first project out of many. 
You can find my other projects on my github(https://github.com/Bryce-Soghigian), or you can go back to my portfolio and they 
will have proper links.
